<!--
  File: doctors/templates/doctors/includes/quick_actions.html
  Purpose:
    - Doctor-specific wrapper that prepares/passes actions to the root quick_actions component.
  Notes:
    - This wrapper keeps doctor-specific defaults here while reusing the root quick_actions.html.
    - Uses Factory pattern via presenters.build_action in the view (see presenters.py).
  SOLID:
    - SRP: wrapper only passes actions; mapping/resolution is done in presenters/views.
