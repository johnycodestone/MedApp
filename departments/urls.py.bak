"""
departments/urls.py

Purpose:
  - Provide non-breaking URL configuration for the Departments app.
  - Preserve existing API endpoints exactly as they are (so other apps/clients
    are not affected).
  - Add safe, explicit frontend UI routes under the `ui/` prefix so the team
    can view the HTML pages kept inside each app's frontend folder
    (e.g., departments_frontend/templates/...). This keeps the API routes
    unchanged and avoids accidental breakage.

Notes:
  - Keep this file under MedApp/departments/urls.py.
  - If you later want the root `/departments/` to render the HTML page instead
    of the API, we can change that intentionally — do not change it now unless
    the whole team agrees.
