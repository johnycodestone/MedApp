<!-- {#
  hospital_card.html
  Purpose:
    - App-level include that wraps the root shared card component.
    - Receives a single `hospital` object from the list view.
    - Uses precomputed attributes (`hospital.badges`, `hospital.kpis`) prepared in views.py.
    - Keeps template logic simple: only loops and conditionals, no complex Python-like syntax.

  Expected input:
    - hospital: Hospital model instance with fields:
        - id, name, city, image_url, is_verified, beds_total, beds_available, specialties_count
    - hospital.badges: list of dicts { label, variant } (built in view)
    - hospital.kpis: list of dicts { label, value } (built in view)

  Notes:
    - This file delegates rendering to the root-level card.html component.
    - All heavy lifting (badges, KPIs) is done in the view, so template stays clean.
    - Safe and minimal: no invalid [] or {} syntax in template.
